# âš¡ CPU Scheduling Algorithms in Java

An implementation of popular CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling) using Java.  
The program allows users to enter the number of processes, Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority through the terminal and calculates Completion Time (CT), Turnaround Time (TAT), and Waiting Time (WT).

## âœ¨ Features

âœ… Supports 4 Scheduling Algorithms:
- First Come First Serve (FCFS) â€“ Non-preemptive  
- Shortest Job First (SJF) â€“ Non-preemptive  
- Round Robin â€“ Preemptive with user-defined time quantum  
- Priority Scheduling â€“ Non-preemptive  

âœ… User-defined Number of Processes 

âœ… Interactive input for:
- Arrival Time (AT)
- Burst Time (BT)
- Priority (for Priority Scheduling)

âœ… Calculates and displays:
- Completion Time (CT)
- Turnaround Time (TAT)
- Waiting Time (WT)
- Average WT & TAT
